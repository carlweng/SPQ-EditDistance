# SPQ-EditDistance

Privacy-preserving edit distance is based on Yao's garbled circuits. It's secure against semi-honest adversaries. The whole framework of two-party computation is copied from [emp-sh2pc](https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-sh2pc).

The protocol implemented here follows [this paper](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/yh33/mypub/ped.pdf "Secure SPQ").
